		<p><b><i>YOUR FULL NAME: </i></b>Donald Craig Hardin Jr. (but most people call me Donnie)</p>
		<p><b><i>YOUR LOCATION: </i></b>Raleigh, North Carolina</p>
		<p><b><i>ONE WORD THAT DESCRIBES HOW YOU WORK: </i></b>Sustainably</p>
		<p><b><i>CURRENT GIG : </i></b>Support Engineer, Sensus/Xylem, Inc.</p>

                </br>
                <p><b><i>TELL US ABOUT YOUR (PROFESSIONAL) SELF:</i></b></p>
		</br>
		
		<p>Ultimately, I am a solver of problems, and a builder of solutions. I have dedicated my life to solving problems with solutions in the digital realm. If this were 1952, I might have been an industrial designer, a machinist, or a copywriter. In the twenty-first centry, so many things have been abstracted into a digital form. As a software engineer, I get to be all of those things, and a few things more!</p>

		</br>

		<p>

		There are a lot of different things a technology professional can focus on, but I have found that I am most interested and competent with matters of software. My talents do not lie with assembly, soldering, or racking / stacking. I am not very good with my hands in that fashion. Much of my experience lies with the configuration of server operating systems (namely Linux, but sometimes microsoft's server operating systems) to host applications that many people can use to do their work effectively. I now want to leverage that skill set towards a professional domain that I am most interested in: <b> Web Application Development. </b>

		</p>
	
		</br>	
		
		<p><b><i>SO YOU WANT TO BE A WEB DEVELOPER?</i></b></p> 

		</br>

		<p>

		Yes, I have gained experience with disciplines that are vital for professionally developing web applications. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree from The University of North Carolina at Greensboro, where I majored in Information Systems and Operations Management. Coursework included: 
			
                      </p>

		<p><b><i>WHEN DID YOU DECIDE THAT YOU WANTED TO FOCUS ON WEB DEVELOPMENT?</i></b></p>

                </br>

		<p>During my last few years in the technology industry, I have had exposure to many different functional areas and cultures. I don't have much interest or talent in hardware. Network and System Administration is ok, but I'm not the authoritarian sort. I noticed that my greatest contributions to my employers have been in the form of something that I have <b>built.</b>While my position at Wake Forest Baptist Health required much of my time occupied with application support duties, I did have the opportunity to build software solutions through the entirety of the Software Development Life Cycle. The positive impact that my solutions yielded were very stirring. That was when I decided that I wanted to focus my career towards web development. </p>

		</br>

		<p><b><i>WHAT JOB TITLES HAVE YOU HELD THAT RELATE TO WEB DEVELOPMENT?</i></b></p>

		</br>

		<p>While attending university, I was an <b> E-Commerce Specialist </b> for <b>Goodwill Industries of Central North Carolina. </b> After graduating in 2012, I interned as an <b> Oracle Applications Administrator </b> at <b> Red Hat, Inc. </b> After that, I stayed on with <b> Red Hat, Inc. </b> where I performed many functions as a <b> Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator and Engineer. </b> I was later offered an opportunity as a <b>Senior Programmer Analyst</b> with <b> Wake Forst Baptist Health. </b> 

		</p>

		</br> 

		<p><b><i>HMMM...RED HAT..Isn't That...Linux?</i></b></p>

		</br>

		<p> Yes indeed. It was at Red Hat where I truly formulated my understanding of the industry landscape. It may be dichotomous thinking on my part, but it seems to me that most of the Information Technology industry is split into two camps: Microsoft... and everything else. Microsoft has long held the majority market share when it comes to all things computing. Most people have a computer that is running Microsoft Windows as the operating system (one figure I saw says that for every apple mac user, there are 9 windows pc users). However, when it comes to the infrastructure that powers the internet, the numbers are a bit different: more than half of the web servers in the world use a UNIX or UNIX-like operating system to host websites and web applications (Linux is a UNIX-like operating system), rather than a microsoft-based operating system. I have become very skilled in the administration and engineering of Linux based systems, and I am an evangelist for open source technologies and tools.

		</p>

		</br>

		<p><b><i>I SUPPOSE YOU ARE NOT LOOKING FOR A POSITION IN A .NET SHOP...</i></b></p>

		<p> I'm not opposed to it, especially now that Microsoft has improved their platforms by leaps and bounds over the last few years. I just prefer technologies and tools that are not as constrained by a particular vendor. Most of what can be created using Microsoft's C# language can be implemented using Java. I have also felt that Microsoft's sharepoint platform is a bit bloated, whereas other content management solutions like Drupal or Wordpress offer superior user experiences. There are also many non-proprietary web development technoligies that overlap into .Net land (REST and XML based api's, Javascript, non-proprietary SQL or non-relational databases, and even Python based solutions.</p> 

		</br>

		<p><b><i>WHAT KIND OF WORK ENVIRONMENT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?</i></b></p>
                
		</br>

		<p>I would like to work in a diverse environment with other talented developers to build and/or improve important applications. A few things come to mind:</p>

		<ul>

                      <li><p>A peer review system so that I can improve my craft based on the input of other developers.</p></li>

                      <li><p>A healthy, positive, and collaborative environment (egos kept in check).</p></li>

                      <li><p>Challenging and realistic deadlines and expectations.</p></li>

                      <li><p>An effective communications workflow (slack, irc, video conferencing, pastebins for code exchange.</p></li>

                      <li><p>Freedom to work in different areas other than my assigned desk (some of my best work has been produced at the picnic table)</p></li>

                      <li><p>Regular 1-on-1's with manager, and even team members</p></li>

                        </ul>

		 

                <p> I must be allowed to wear headphones and listen to music while I work. This is not negotiable. </p>
                <p> It needs to have a healthy infrastructure for remote work. I would like the place to have a few remote workers, even if I am not one of them! I prefer to work remote, but I miss the office and my office mates sometimes. No matter what, employees in my field need to be allowed to work remotely at least one day out of the week.</p>

                </br>


		<p><b><i>WHAT KIND OF PHONE DO YOU USE?</i></b></p> 
		</br>
		<p>"I have been using the Oneplus One for two years now. Considering the recent dissolution of the Cyanogen company, I will probably go a different direction with my next mobile device." </p>
		</br>
		<p><b><i>HOW ABOUT YOUR COMPUTERS?</i></b></p>
		</br>
		<p>"I value the ability to be able to work anywhere and everywhere, most of my gadgets reflect this. My primary computer is a Dell XPS 13 with Xubuntu as the OS. I managed to fit a 1TB ssd, and the system comes with 8GB of RAM preinstalled. This allows me to house and run many virtual computers with various configurations."</p>
		</br>
		<p>I also have a Lenovo X230 with Fedora 26. It is a bit larger and heavier than my Dell, but it is great to have as a backup in case the XPS 13 runs into problems. </p>
		</br>
		<p><b><i>TELL US A LITTLE ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND AND AND HOW YOU GOT TO WHERE YOU ARE TODAY.</i></b></p>
                </br>
                <p>"As a kid, I gravitated towards building toys: Blocks, Legos, Construx, and that eventually lead me to be</p>
		</br>
		<p> I became exposed to computers in my gradeschool years; the first one I ever used was an Apple II, and my first home PC was a Tandy Sensation i486 from Radio Shack. During my high school years, I wasn’t very sure what I should do with my life, nor did I truly know or comprehend what my options might be.</p>
		</br>
		<p> I served in the Coast Guard reserve for a time, and then did some work to pursue a career in allied health. It did not take me long to realize that I was not at all interested in any medical profession, so after a few different odd jobs, I finally decided that I should pursue a career in technology. I got a book from the library on visual basic and wrote my first “hello world” program.</p>
		</br>
		<p>I was determined to earn a bachelors degree, so in 2008 I enrolled in a local university (UNCG) and graduated in 2012. At the time, I was not interested in programming or web development, in fact, I wasn’t really sure where I wanted to specialize, or which area of tech fascinated me the most.</p>
		</br>
		<p> I had become exposed to linux in my early days at university and fell in love. I really enjoyed using it to build websites and was amazed at the degree of freedom I had to customize my experience. I didn’t even have to pay for the right to use it!</p>
		</br>
		<p>While at university, I was pretty good at working on group projects in small teams, received good feedback. Most of them I was an individual contributor, and two I was the lead. </p>
		</br>
		<p>I scored a postgrad IT internship with Red Hat, hoping that I would be hired on for an FTE role upon completion. It was a challenging assignment. I was with the IT Finance and Facilities team, a tier II team dedicated to being Finance and Facilities representation in IT. I gained a lot of experience with Oracle’s ERP products, database administration, and large system implementation.</p> 
		</br>
		<p>Upon completion of the internship, I was disappointed to learn that there was a “hiring freeze” in place, but I was invited to remain onboard as a contractor. I decided to put in for a position with another business unit, which required passing examinations for the coveted “Red Hat Certified System Administrator, and Red Hat Certified Engineer”.</p> 
		</br>
		<p>At the time, I was able to pass the RHCSA, but not the RHCE. Speaking with some of the instructors, it seemed that my typing habits were hindering my ability to complete in time. I was embarrased to admit that I had never learned to touch type. This was one of those hard life lessons. </p>
		</br>
		<p>A colleague with the global service desk said there was an opening, and I went to work for them. Over the course of the next two years, I worked with maintaining linux systems and end user configurations. Once I felt I had built up experience, I took the RHCE exam once more and knocked it out of the park!</p>
		</br>
		<p>I shifted to remote work for the final year and found that I was made for it. However, since I was still on contract, I was having a hard time making ends meet due to high health insurance costs.</p>
		</br>
		<p>A former acquaintence introduced me to Wake Forest Baptist Health as a Senior Programmer/Analyst. I worked there for two years.</p>
		</br>
		<p>By January of 2016, I decided that I wanted to direct my career into the more technical side, I took on side projects and night courses at the local college.</p> 
		</br>
		<p>Since the position I held with WFBH was not conducive to study, I decided to resign in order to complete my refresher and run out my MGIB. I have a portfolio of projects on github, contributed to the fedora project, and explored advanced programming topics in Java, PHP, Html/css, and Python
" </p>
		</br>
                <p><b><i>WHAT ARE THE APPS, SOFTWARE, TOOLS, ETC. THAT YOU CANT LIVE WITHOUT?</i></b></p>
                </br>
		
		<p> Oh, my life was saved by Google Drive. I keep my daily work journal, project list, an idea journal, and all sorts of other things in there. It's very accessable and eliminates the need for carrying a physical notebook or portfolio.</p>

		</br>
		
		<p> I am a bookmarks junkie. I primariy use google chrome, and firefox to a lesser extent. Each is overflowing with bookmarks that I regularly sort and clense. So many articles, how-to's, manuals, tools etc. are hosted online.</p>

		</br>

		<p>

		I make significant use of Autokey on my linux workstation, and AutoHotKey on windows. Software engineering and administration requires far more attention to communication than most people realize. Every day, devs like myself are building and/or maintaining systems that many people depend on. With support tickets, feature requests, and other communications coming in by the boatload, I rely on my shortcuts to deliver effective responses so that I can devote more focus on my core work. Every so often, I will go through my sentbox and look for any similar sounding responses. If I find a few, I take it, abstract it, and add it to my clippings list. For example:

		</p>

		<p>

		Sorry to hear about the problem with $SERVICE. I wish I had some better news concerning it. I'll do my best to explain what's going on. Here goes:
		On $DATE, during maintenance of $SERVICE, 
		At this time, $TEAM is currently investigating the issue, but there is no current ETA on a fix.
		I truly apologize for all of this.

		</p>

		</br>

		<p> 

		It's a little bit of an art to avoid sounding like a robot.
